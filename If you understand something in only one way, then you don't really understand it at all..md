"If you understand something in only one way, then you don't really understand it at all." (Marvin Minsky)

If you have only one representation for something, what happens when that representation "runs out"? You have to switch to another representation or you are interminably stuck.

This pattern applies to itself. Fault-tolerance is one way to understand it. Some other ways:
- The very act of having multiple representations makes the individual representations object
- All representations leave something out and if having only one representation for an object risks overlooking something that is very important, if not in this context then another. For example, a single representation is very unlikely to be able to deal with any multi-scale complexity. This is paricularly important when exposure matters more than accuracy.
- Multiple representations that appear to be mutually exclusive but both apply usefully to an object can be generalized or synthesized to create a much more powerful representation, like algebraic geometry or wave-particle duality. Minimally, if the two representations apply in different contexts, learning these scope conditions is useful.

# This pattern used:
- To clarify: "Subject/object"
- To clarify: The representation of a representation itself. What does a representation do? Renders something "computable"? What could "computable" mean? Apply this pattern to "representation": what are other ways to think about it?
- To clarify: Principle of marginal control
- To clarify: convexity to model error
